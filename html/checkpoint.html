                degrees in physics and economics. Musk's career began with the co-founding of Zip2, a software <br>
                company sold for nearly $300 million. He then founded X.com, which became PayPal and was acquired <br>
                by eBay for $1.5 billion. In 2002, Musk founded SpaceX to reduce space transportation costs and <br>
                pursue Mars colonization. He also became a key figure at Tesla, revolutionizing the electric vehicle <br>
                industry. Musk's ventures expanded to include SolarCity, Neuralink, and The Boring Company, <br>
                showcasing his commitment to innovation and sustainability. Despite numerous challenges, Musk <br>
